## Notes:
- Files should be in M4A format
- File names are case-sensitive (use uppercase letters)
- These should be the phonetic sounds of letters, not the letter names
- If an audio file is missing, the app will fallback to text-to-speech
- Each audio file will be played repeatedly with a 1-second pause until the spacebar is pressed
